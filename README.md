![Part 1 Summary Table](https://github.com/raven-rivas/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Challenge_figure_1.PNG)

# This table shows that the average fare per rides between the city types, and rural cities have the highest average fare per compared to the suburban and urban by approximately four dollarsand 10 dollars. The column of average fare per driver and rural cities   perfomed 40% better than suburban cities and 230% better than urban cities. This is found because the rider and driver count of rural cities was much lower than for urban and suburban cities, which leads to higher average values for rural cities.

# This Multiple-Line Plot chows that total fare per city type over the course of four months; 01-01-2019 - 04-28-2019 and total fare on the horizontal y-axis. The Urban cities line shows that it has the highest total fares throughout this time period and Rural cities have the lowest. Suburban line is in between these two city types.
# The Urban line has several peaks increasing in March and April and so does Urban cities. The trends in Urban and Rural are very similar where Urban's total fares trended up to $2,500 in early March and Rural's line ran up to $400.
